#       Change Log: v1.4.0
- **Dependencies**
  - BunnyLibs: 0.1.0 (Added) - This is a set of features I use in all my mods, so they'll likely all require it going forward.
  - RogueLibs: 4.0.0 (Updated)
- **Feature Additions**
  - Spanish localization! Huge thanks to GenEric for his hard work and great sense of humor!
  - Agent Default Goals: 
    - Electrocuted
    - Electrocuted (Permanent)
    - Frozen
    - Frozen (Fragile)
    - Frozen (Permanent)
  - Designer Traits
    - Behavior
      - Vigilance (group): Determines how the agent reacts to sound, in regards to investigation and property.
    - Interaction
      - Pay Big Quest: NPC accepts Slum Dweller Big Quest payments. Made the text more neutral (doesn't say it's to pay for a home), to accommodate custom lore.
    - Passive
      - Plot-Critical: Players explode if this agent is neutralized.
    - Permanent Status Effects
      - These were slated for Resistance HR, but by request I've added Designer versions here. It should cover most or all of the vanilla status effects.
- **Tweaks**
  - Second-tier traits ("+ traits") are now only available in the character creator in the Designer Edition. This part of the game is pretty hardcoded, so making this change resolved several bugs.
  - Immovable is now a Player Trait. Get ready to not get moved.
  - Agents spawned via Friend Phone will now re-roll their appearance if they have the traits for it, since they're not canonically clones. And have you ever met someone whose friends all looked like them? Creepy.
  - Scumbags are no longer automatically Guilty. Not because of due process or anything.
  - LOS Behaviors: Eat Corpses & Suck Blood no longer require a matching Special Ability. Pick Pockets still requires Sticky Glove.
  - Random Teleport Scene Setter will no longer place NPCs close to the starting elevator. We'll have to devise new ways to spawnkill you.
- **Bug Fixes**
  - NPCs should now answer doors properly, instead of stopping short of interaction range like you're a doodoo salesman.
  - Upgrading traits no longer leaves the base trait. That's right, you lose who you once were. Try not to let a wistful tear make you step into a crusher trap.
  - Previously fixed vanilla bug, but now documenting: Broken objects should no longer drop bugged items with "E_" in the name. 
  - Indestructible NPCs with Explode on Death now properly gib when they explode. Emergence is a bitch sometimes.
  - Agents with a Scene Setter applied are now ineligible for secret Shapeshifter uh... insertion.
  - Language system no longer blocks interaction in Home Base. As far as I'm aware, all this did was cause a conflict with the Chaos At Home Base mod. Well, now you can talk to that one Werewolf again. I'm sure he's relieved too.
  - Language Teacher interactions should work properly now. NPCs weren't doing some kind of Weinstein thing, the menus were just not working.
  - Zombified characters now properly copy appearances. Previously they would copy their appearance from the saved version of a custom NPC, causing appearance-rolled NPCs to suddenly match appearances when they become zombies. This one was a sumbitch to fix, so you'd better make 10 campaigns that use it.
  - Bomb Processor & Watergun now have proper prices in custom shops.
  - Shelved bugs (WILL NOT BE FIXED):
    - Concealed Carry works inconsistently with NPCs Sitting/Sleeping/Dancing.
    - Reloading the game and continuing from a save will likely break any modded content. This is a limitation with RogueLibs and out of my control.
    - The Character Select screen's "Ctrl - Randomize Appearance" function is broken. This is simply too minor for me to give a shit about.
