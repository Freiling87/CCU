#       Change Log: v1.4.0
- **Dependencies**
  - BunnyLibs: 0.1.0 (Added) - This is a set of features I use in all my mods, so they'll likely all require it going forward.
  - RogueLibs: 4.0.0 (Updated)
- **Feature Additions**
  - Agent Default Goals: 
    - Electrocuted
    - Electrocuted (Permanent)
    - Frozen
    - Frozen (Fragile)
    - Frozen (Permanent)
  - Designer Traits
    - Behavior
      - Vigilance (group): Determines how the agent reacts to sound, in regards to investigation and property.
    - Passive
      - Plot-Critical: Players explode if this agent is neutralized.
- **Tweaks**
  - Second-tier player traits are no longer available in the character creator. The game + RogueLibs are not designed to accommodate those as an option properly.
  - Immovable is now a Player Trait.
  - Agents spawned via Friend Phone will now re-roll their appearance if they have the traits for it, since they're not clones.
  - Scumbags are no longer automatically Guilty.
  - LOS Behaviors: Eat Corpses & Suck Blood no longer require a Special Ability. Pick Pockets still does.
  - Random Teleport Scene Setter will no longer place NPCs close to the starting elevator. 
- **Bug Fixes**
  - Upgrading traits no longer leaves the base trait.
  - Previously fixed vanilla bug but now documenting: Broken objects should no longer drop bugged items with "E_" in the name.
  - Indestructible NPCs with Explode on Death now properly gib when they explode.
  - Agents with a Scene Setter applied are now ineligible for secret Shapeshifter uh... insertion.
  - Language system no longer blocks interaction in Home Base. As far as I'm aware, all this did was cause a conflict with the Chaos At Home Base mod.
  - Language Teacher interactions should work properly now.
