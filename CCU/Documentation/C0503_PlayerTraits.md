Player Traits

Just normal SOR traits, accessible by players. Cost Nuggets to unlock, because CCU is a scam to get your precious nuggets. Sucker!

**\* Rubber Bullet rules** 
- If rubber bullet damage reduces an NPC's health to 10% or lower, they are knocked out. This counts as if you had used Chloroform or a Tranquilizer gun on them.
- If they go below -10%, they are killed... but less lethally! Rubber Bullet guns are usable by Pacifists.
- Electronic characters are not vulnerable

##			Language
Note that these have limited utility in vanilla chunks. They are more useful in custom content where the designer has made use of the language system. Check out Cyan_Light's Vendor Variety chunkpack if you want to try these out: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2851981424
