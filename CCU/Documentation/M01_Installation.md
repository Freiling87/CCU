Installation
</h1>
<br><br>

Mod installation instructions are [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2271959380).

1. **Choose an edition**
  - **Designer Edition:** This edition shows all CCU content on Trait & Mutator lists. Use this if you want to make advanced workshop content.
  - **Player Edition:** This edition hides CCU content so that you can just play it without seeing cluttered trait/mutator menus. Use this if you just want to play stuff that uses CCU.

2. **Get Dependencies**

CCU requires a few modding libraries to work:
  - RogueLibs
  - RogueLibsPatcher
  - BTHarmonyUtils

Get them at the link above.
