Agent Default Goals
</h1>
<br><br>

Default Goals are where you define how an Agent placed in a chunk will act. E.g., "Wander In Chunk (Owner)." 

##		Scene Setters
Scene Setters are for ambience. They trigger immediately when the level loads. Note that these are compatible with Explode on Death, so you can use these to make a lot of adjustments to your level.
