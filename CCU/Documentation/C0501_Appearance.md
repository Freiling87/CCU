Appearance System

<img src="../Resources/Image/CCU/Appearance_Examples.png" align="right" width="400">


There are a *lot* of traits in this category, but the system is very simple. 

Most traits refer to a single value in the character creator, e.g. "Blue Legs," "Mohawk," etc. Some of them refer to groups, e.g. "Punk Hairstyles," or "Human Skin Tones." They are all compatible, so you could use the overlap between "Mohawk" and "Punk Hairstyles" if you want to slightly weight the pool towards that particular style. Others have special effects, like Pantsless, which matches Leg color to Skin color. 

All added appearance traits are thrown into pools for each type. When the NPC is generated, a random selection is pulled from each pool for its appearance. If a pool is empty, the default appearance from the character creator is used for that element. The end result is that NPC classes will have variable appearances.

Note that the default appearance in the character creator's appearance page does *not* add values to appearance pools. 

#				Best Practices
Below are just my baseline insights from playing around with the system while developing it. If you have any tips you want to add here, get in touch with me.

####				Test En Masse
With so many random variables, it's hard to tell whether the look is perfect unless you see a ton of examples. Use a chunk with lots of copies of the same NPC to identify weird edge cases and gradually sculpt an aesthetic. 

One bonus is that if you decide to share this character on the workshop, you can use that picture to give a more accurate idea of what the character will tend to look like.

####				Creative Weighting
Use the grouped traits and redundancy to your advantage. Here's an example trait list:
> Black Hair, Brown Hair, Blonde Hair, Normal Hair Colors, Normal Hair Colors (No Grey), Wild Hair Colors

This combination has three copies of the most common hair colors (two copies each are applied by *Normal Hair Colors* and *Normal Hair Colors (No Grey)*. Orange hair is demographically rare so it's not added a third time. Wild Hair Colors are only added once, to make dyed hair somewhat rare. 

####				Less is More... More or Less
It's tempting to throw a ton of traits into the list. But keep in mind part of what makes Streets of Rogue brilliant: That appearances *don't* vary that much in vanilla, because making everything immediately visually identifiable was one of the designer's priorities. And that's what made its fast-paced gameplay work so naturally. In fact, I might go so far as to say that *most* of your NPCs should probably only vary in hair and skin colors, like vanilla ones.

This is not to say that highly visually-variable agents aren't useful. It can be good if you want to surprise the player, present visual variety through a human backdrop of nobodies, or give a faction's footsoldiers a bit of texture. But if you go too crazy with it, the player will never know who they're interacting with without checking their name manually. And your characters will all kind of dissolve into an amorphous mass of... everything all at once.

As with all things, go crazy in moderation!
