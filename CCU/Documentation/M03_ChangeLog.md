##		v 1.1.0

- **Feature Additions**

    - Traits are now auto-sorted according to the mode selected on the Traits screen (Name / Value).
  - Systems
	- Appearance: You can now randomize the appearance of custom NPCs through a trait interface. Details [here](/CCU/Documentation/C0501_Appearance.md).
    - Loadout: You can now define custom randomized inventories for NPCs through a trait interface. Details [here](/CCU/Documentation/C0502_Loadout.md).

        - Remise Beast
      - Ranged Combat
        - Pants on Autofire
        - Trigger Happy
        - Trigger Junkie
    - Relationships
      - Cool Cannibal no longer gates Merchant interactions. I'll be adding some special gates to those later on.
      - Hostile to Vampire: Now applies hostility against anyone with the Suck Blood behavior trait.
      - Faction trait breakdown: Combining these in the 0.1.1 update was admittedly a mistake. Due to feedback I've split them back up. As usual, you won't have to update your characters if you're okay with the replacements. 
        Note that Alignment & Hostility traits will still technically work like factions, treating an Aligned agent in some situations as if they were the class they're aligned with. E.g., Hostile to Blahd will be hostile to Aligned to Blahd.
        For each entry below, characters with the trait on the left will have it replaced with the trait(s) on the right.
        - Faction Blahd Aligned → Aligned to Blahd, Hostile to Crepe
        - Faction Cannibal Aligned → Aligned to Cannibal, Hostile to Soldier
        - Faction Crepe Aligned → Aligned to Crepe, Hostile to Blahd
        - Faction Firefighter Aligned → Aligned to Firefighter
        - Faction Gorilla Aligned → Aligned to Gorilla, Hostile to Scientist, Specistist
        - Faction Soldier Aligned → Aligned to Soldier, Hostile to Cannibal
  - Default Goals
	- Random Teleport 
  - Objects
	- The Vendor Cart is no longer accessible as a normal container. It requires an operating bar to access, and will make a small noise that might alert the owner as you ransack it. Sneaky/Silent Fingers both apply. 
  - Items
    - Class-A-Ware: Scan NPCs to see their full trait lists, and gain XP in the process. A QOL addition due to the increased diversity of NPC classes you'll see in CCU content.
- **Bugfixes**
  - Level Editor
    - Fixed Vanilla bug that caused Investigateable (Sign) text to be copied between Objects.
  - Default Goals
	- Scene Setters are no longer interrupted by "Flee" behaviors.
    - Random Teleport no longer breaks the Scene Setter system.
  - Objects
	- Containers
	  - Can no longer loot via hack - Lame!
	  - Disabled redundant Open/Search buttons.
      - "Search" button no longer shows up on empty containers.
	- Investigateables
	  - Computer no longer interrupts hacking interaction when Investigation text is set.
	  - Investigate button no longer appears with blank text.
  - Traits
    - Addict: Increased damage that Withdrawal can do to NPCs. This is a tweak to an oversight in the vanilla code that made it have almost no effect.
	- Grab Everything: No longer grabs active traps, unless agent has Accident-Prone
	- Extortable: Multiple Extortables with Matching Owner ID in same chunk are now handled as a group rather than separately. Duplicate Extortion buttons eliminated.
	- Heal: No longer says broken dialogue when rejecting interaction
	- Language Speaker group: Removed from upgrade menu in Augmentation Booth. This is a planned feature that was meant to be postponed.
	- Rel Faction: Sharing faction animosity can no longer improve your relations with others. 
	- Pay Cop Debt: Button text fixed.
	- Cost Scale: Now excludes Bribe for Quest Item.
	- Relationship: No longer affect Home Base
- **Fixes to Vanilla**
  - Custom NPCs ranged and melee combat behaviors now scale normally according to their appropriate skill.

- **Tweaks**
  - Loadout - Mayor Badge is deactivated for the time being. There's a lot of hardcoded logic for the Mayor Village and I need to be more thorough before I can release related features.
  - Pay Debt is now scaled to Cost Scale traits
  - Untrusting/er/est: Added exceptions for Leave Weapons Behind, Offer Motivation, Pay Debt & Pay Entrance Fee.
- **Bugfixes**
  - Pick Pockets no longer cancels the setup of various interaction and merchant traits
  - Drug Warrior - Wildcard now runs without crashing the game
  - Text color restored to yellow for non-English versions (this was a feature test accidentally left in)
  - Vending Machines' cost interactions now load correctly
  - Codpiece now spawns correctly in shops
  - Influence Election no longer persists after use
  - Removed Research Gun from Tech Mart & Research inventories
  - Chunk Key Holder & Chunk Safe Combo Holder now actually work
  - Honorable Thief now correctly gates Shop Access vis-a-vis Honor Among Thieves
  - CCU traits now correctly hidden from Augmentation Booth, Possession Trait List
  - Decoupled various Killer Robot behaviors that were hardcoded to Seek & Destroy (Water damage, EMP vulnerability, Knockback bonus, walking through Doors). 
- **Feature Limitation**
  - Bad news: Continuing a saved run will not load all mod content. This is way beyond my technical ability to fix, and not scoped in Roguelibs at this point. So unfortunately, this is not likely to be fixed in the near future. Mod content should be played in a single session for best results.
- **Trait Update System:** I've renamed and slightly reorganized some of the traits. This system should automatically update outdated traits both on spawn and on loading in the character editor. You will not have to update character files, and all versions of CCU will be backwards-compatible with un-updated content.
  - **Class Name Overlaps:** A few traits shared names with certain vanilla classes, causing their description in the character select page to be overwritten.
    - Hire Type
      - Hacker → Cyber-Intruder
    - Merchant Type
      - Shopkeeper → General Store
      - Soldier → Army Quartermaster
      - Thief → Intruder's Warehouse
      - Vampire → Bloodsucker Bazaar
  - **Class-based Faction Relationship Traits:** Most of the agent-based relationship traits only included hostility to a class' enemies. This doesn't fully cover the scope of the vanilla feature, so these have been expanded to treat certain agent types as factions. The traits now include mutual alignment with vanilla agents of that class, plus mutual hostility with that class' enemies.
    - Bashable → Faction Blahd Aligned
    - Crushable → Faction Crepe Aligned
    - Hostile to Cannibal → Faction Soldier Aligned
    - Hostile to Soldier → Faction Cannibal Aligned
    - Specistist → Faction Gorilla Aligned

[^1]: This is a Player feature. This means it will be accessible by players, and won't have all the [CCU] name prefixes that Designer-only content has. It also costs Nuggets to unlock, because CCU is a scam to get your precious nuggets. Sucker!
