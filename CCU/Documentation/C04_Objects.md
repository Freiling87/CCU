Objects
</h1>
<br>
<br>

Objects! They are the things we know and have opinions about, and sometimes they are neither of those things. It's all a matter of perspective, maybe. I don't care. But this introduction isn't empty anymore.

##			Containers
Some objects can now contain Items. See the Object Variables list below for specifics.

##			Investigation
You can now write and read text with several objects as if they were Signs. The player views this text with the "Investigate" interaction (wording intended to be as broad as possible). See the Object Variables list below for specifics.

##			Object Variables
The full list of modifiable variables added to all Objects. **(V)** indicates the variable slot is already occupied by Vanilla content. Or... are those the Vegan options? I forget.
