#		Vanilla Bugs
- Exclude Vanilla Chunks button doesn't work. Vanilla content always shows up.
- When you have a level with placed chunks and random chunks, some of the placed chunks are added to the random selection pool.
- NPCs equipped with Ghost Gibber refuse to use it on ghosts
- Map seed set with keyboard input from home base
- "Remove Slave Helmet with Wrench" and Guard Duty BQ should not be limited by Vocally Challenged. Other BQs get the pass so it would make sense. And you don't need to communicate to remove a helmet, but that's a judgment call.
- If you use a Hacking Device on a Clone Machine while at your follower limit, it will waste the item without giving you the clone.
- NPCs often do not path properly to exit elevators in custom chunks, depending on floor ownership. Since they'll charge blindly out of prisons when you free them, they should charge blindly into owned tiles to reach the elevator.
