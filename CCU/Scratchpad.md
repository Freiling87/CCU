#			How to read this
If you wandered in here out of curiosity, this is my working notes file, and completed/planned feature list. It's a markdown file, but best viewed in raw form since a lot of its organization has to do with text characters' alignment.

Listed in order of Parent tier summary symbol priority:
	C, T = Code this, Test this
	H = Hold, usually pending resolution of a separate or grouped issue
	√ = Fully implemented feature or group of features

HEY BRO ALT+UP TO JUMP TO METHOD SIGNATURE
#		Scope
##		T	Restrict Trait Count 
to legalize characters
CharacterCreation.CreateTallyText
Also includes an attempt at custom CCU trait list separate from the rest.
##			T	Custom Decal Pilot
I put a Custom Floor Decal item in the Editor Object List. Nothing else. See what kind of errors pop up to determine what to patch.
##			P	v. 1.0.1 Patch Notes
- Bugfixes
  - Default Goals
	- Scene Setters are no longer interrupted by "Flee" behaviors.
  - Objects
	- Containers
	  - Can no longer loot via hack (Lame!)
	  - Disabled redundant Open/Search buttons.
	- Investigateables
	  - Computer no longer interrupts hacking interaction when Investigation text is set.
	  - Investigate button no longer appears with blank text.
  - Traits
	- Grab Everything: No longer grabs active traps, unless agent has Accident-Prone
	- Extortable: Multiple Extortables with Matching Owner ID in same chunk are now handled as a group rather than separately. Duplicate Extortion buttons eliminated.
	- Heal: No longer says broken dialogue when rejecting interaction
	- Language Speaker group: Removed from upgrade menu in Augmentation Booth. This is a planned feature that was meant to be postponed.
	- Rel Faction: Sharing faction animosity can no longer improve your relations with others. 
	- Pay Cop Debt: Button text fixed.
	- Cost Scale: Now excludes Bribe for Quest Item.
	- Relationship: No longer affect Home Base
- Feature Additions
  - Default Goals
	- Random Teleport 
  - Objects
	- The Vendor Cart is no longer accessible as a normal container. It requires an operating bar to access, and will make a small noise as you ransack it. Sneaky/Silent Fingers both apply.
  - Traits
	- Appearance
	  - You can now randomize the appearance of NPCs. See the Traits page for details, as there are too many traits to list here.
	  - Feature limitation: Eye type may change for Sitting/Dancing NPCs. This is a bug (IMO) in the original game code. Specifically: Narrow, Wide, Dead eyes are affected; Zombie & Cannibal eyes are not.
	- Hire Duration
	  - Permanent Hire
	  - Permanent Hire Only
	- Merchant Stock: Various modifiers for the quantity/durability of sold items.
	  - Clearancer
	  - Masterworker
	  - Masterworkerer
	  - Masterworkerest
	  - Shiddy Goods
	  - Shoddy Goods
	  - Wholesaler
	  - Wholesalerer
	  - Wholesalerest
	- Merchant Type: Selecting multiple types will now combine inventory random-choice pools rather than just selecting one of them.
	  - Burger Joint
	  - Sugar Shack
##			P	v. 1.0.1 Documentation Additions
Note that the Header tiers are extended by one in Scratchpad, so you'll need to adjust those.
###				Object Variable List
Vendor Cart mechanics note
###				Appearance
There are a *lot* of traits in this category, grouped into the following. They have abbreviated prefixes, in order to keep sorting together but save some space. I'm not going to list every single trait in here, just the unusual ones.

- App AC1: Accessory
- App BC1: Body Color
- App BC3: Body Color Special
- App BT1: Body Type
- App BT2: Body Type Greyscale
- App EC1: Eye Color
- App ET1: Eye Type
- App FH1: Facial Hair
- App HC1: Hair Color
- App HC2: Hair Color Grouped
- App HS1: Hairstyle
- App HS2: Hairstyle Grouped
- App LC1: Legs Color
- App LC3: Legs Color Special
- App SC1: Skin Color
- App SC2: Skin Color Group

The "Group," uh... groups... have multiple items. "Long hairstyles," "Punk hairstyles," you get it, you're smart. These are just offered as a quicker way to customize appearance without having to do it granularly. Their contents are listed in sections below.

All selections are thrown into a random pool. When the NPC is generated, it pulls a random selection from this pool for its appearance. They are compatible, so you could add Mohawk as well as Punk Styles if you want to slightly weight the pool, but you won't have a ton of control over that. 

####				How it works
By adding an appearance trait, you add an item to a random selection pool. When the agent is spawned as an NPC, its appearance is randomly chosen from all pools with items in them. Empty pools are ignored, and appearance copies the visuals in the character editor.

####				Best Practices
#####					Test Sheet
With so many random variables, it's hard to tell whether the look is perfect unless you see a ton of examples. Use a chunk with a ton of copies of the same NPC to identify weird edge cases and gradually shape a population aesthetic. The bonus is that if you decide to share this character on the workshop, you can use that picture to give a more accurate picture of what the character will look like.

####				BC3: Body Color Special

###				C	Fac Rel Refactor
This might be different from the original enemy of my enemy bug. Test before clearing.
Agent 1 - Wanted / Hostile Fac1
Agent 2 - Law / Hostile Fac2 
Should be hostile, but Rel Fac set to neutral.
###				C	SORCE Mutators not available in Editor levels 
I remember slating this to be done for CCU but never had to. There might be a shortcut to automate this for SORCE if you copy the formatting from CCU.
###				C	Container button text
On loading a chunk, they don't pull and display in the button. They are still in the item, and drop correctly.
P_LevelEditor.SetNameText_Prefix: tileNameText is blank unless defined this session. I.e., item name is not loading here.
P_LevelEditor.ShowCustomInterface: itemName is always blank, which I think means that:
	UpdateInterface_OnSelect_ShowCustomInterface: Loc_43 is not loading what you think it is. tileNameText2 is apparently always blank, but you might be using the default arg wrong for a harmony patch.

###				C	Player Character speaks all

###				C	False "Inventory Full" message
Trying to pick up Whiskey, Replicant Rebel character
Able to replicate?
###				H	Containers Show "(Empty)"
Start_SetupInvDatabasesForContainers sets chestReal to true. This makes it so that (Empty) does display the first time the chunk is run, but not on re-runs.
	This bool is allowing PlayfieldObject.MakeChestNonInteractable to be called, since it's already built to handle any object.
	Re-setting it to true in a PlayfieldObject.SetVars_Postfix didn't have any effect.
It might be the 0-Qty Money item throwing off InvDatabase.IsEmpty. That'd be the next thing to try.

##			C	Enclave System
It's best to work on these piecemeal: mutators, traits, agents. Then combine them when the parts are complete.
###				C	Currency Changing
If you want different currencies, you'll need new ways for players to change it.
####				C	Trait: Behavior - Moneychanger
Cost Scaled
###				C	Enclave: Concrete Jungle
####				C	Agent: Bananamonger
Human vendor, speaks English and Goryllian, spawns with a Vendor cart. Sells bananas at a good price. Great place to change your currency.
####				C	Agent: Cheeky Monkey
Hides in the bushes, pickpockets. Like thieves but even more fucking annoying.
####				C	Currency: Banana
Yeah
####				C	Feature: Banana Vendor
One of the only vendors who takes cash. Sells at a good price. Great place to change money.
####				C	Floor Type: Grass
Yeah
####				C	Laws: Only Bitch Crimes are Illegal
Theft
Vandalism
etc.
Ritual Combat is respected as your right.
####				C	Wall Type: Concrete
Yeah
###				C	Enclave: District 69
####				C	Agent: Nordic
####				C	Agent: Reptilian
####				C	Agent: Small Grey
####				C	Agent: Glorbrax
Secretes alcohol in exchange for raw Moneys
####				C	Currency: Booze
####				C	Floor Type: Steel
####				C	Laws: 
Highly cosmopolitan, no tolerance of slavery...? 
Or maybe factionalized, with highly varying rules according to the chunk
Or maybe their laws are configured to treat you like a test subject.
####				C	Law Enforcers
Apprehension Ray is hard to hit, but teleports you immediately to jail
###				C	Enclave: Necropolis
####				C	Agent: Bloodslave
They don't even complain anymore
####				C	Agent: Necromancer
Expert hire, Can revive any dead agent for hire
####				C	Agent: Ghoul
Feral, eat corpses, hostile but cowardly
####				C	Agent: Sangrist
Currency Changer
####				C	Agent: Z-Rancher
Sells trained zombies, but that's way too OP
####				C	Currency: Blood
####				C	Feature: Canals
Catacomb vibe?
####				C	Floor Type: Dungeony stone
####				C	Wall Type: Brick
###				C	Enclave: Little Foreignia
The most normal of the Enclaves. Nearly identical to vanilla, but people speak Foreign.
###				C	Enclave: Werewales
Um
###				C	Enclave: Haywood & Mt. Blair 
This enclave's special challenge is that it's almost fully dominated by a single powerful faction, the Union.
The mob has a presence here, but the Union is generally not dirty. Generally.
Union refugees were the last group let inside the City before it completely sealed itself off from the outside world. They had missed the deadline, but brought so much important cargo that an exception was made. The shipping containers brought in in that refugee influx are still in use as small buildings. Their trucks ("Rigs") were broken down for parts, but the district retains the name.
####				C	Law: Seniority
Agents with the Old trait start out Friendly with the Law. They paid their dues.
####				C	Faction: Union
A French Vanilla faction, where members generally have Class Solidarity, No In-Fighting, and Confident in Crowds. 
They generally carry tools, power tools, and protective equipment. They don't carry the big guns, but make up for it in solidarity.
Outside Union Town, the Union is still pretty powerful. 
Cops and Firefighters are Union-Aligned, but not vice-versa.

##			C	Language (Overhaul)
###			C	00 Mutator: Our Town
- NPCs have a chance to speak a foreign language
  - If a shopkeeper or bartender speaks a second language, generate a Neon Sign in front of their business in that language (we can dream, right?)
- NPCs have a chance to have Vocally Challenged
  - If they do, they always have at least one foreign language
- Some people become Friendly if you interact in a non-English language. Chance is higher if they don't speak English.
- Enables Polyglot trait choice
- Gives the Translator an actual reason to exist
- All hired agents can act as translators
- Every District has a set of Our Town mutators (below) that may trigger on level 2 of the district.
###			C	00 Our Town Non-Disasters
Gated behind Language System Mutator
Shifts the population so that about 66% are speakers, and one third - 1 half of those don't speak English.
Or you know what, make an overhaul mutator mapped to each class. That's what this is turning into.
- Concrete Jungle (Monkese)
- District 69 (ErSdtAdt)
- Little Faraway (Foreign)
- Meltingpot District (Even distribution of all language groups)
- Werewales (Werewelsh)
- Brainard (Lang Zonbi)

###				Custom Flag list
Allow player to name booleans uniquely.
These should be grouped by Campaign, since that's the only place they're valid.
The config file should match the name of the campaign, if they allow the same characters.
###				Custom Level Tag List?
Not so sure about the utility of this. I don't think players should need more than 4 level tags.
- Whenever you have enough in the campaign to make it playable, test it in Player Edition and see if the experience is the same.

Should not be too hard, as the one method where it's filled out is pretty transparent
Just add a --- CCU TRAITS --- Divider or something

###				C	Keycard System
Red, Blue, Green, Yellow
Work only on Keycard Doors and Keycard Safes
####				C	Access Scope
Determines how far the keycard will work. Doesn't have to use every tier of this, just being expansive.
	Chunk

####				C	Access Level
Configurable in Keycard and Keycard Door
####				C	RFID Flipping
If someone is holding a Keycard, you can grab their card's RFID signal to add it to your keyring. 
This can be done in the manner of a normal hack, or with a Signal Grabber passive inventory item - no interaction required, but shorter range. Good tool for the undercover.

###				C	Key Ring System
Keys are specific to an object. One door, one chest, etc. so chunks may generate with multiple. 
Desk is a lockable container.
####				C	Keyring
Keyring stores all keys in one slot
##			H	Stash System
On hold: Complete the Key/SafeCombo aspect of Containers first.
Locked + Keycoded really only apply to Desk. They might easily be left out of this system.
Variable field in editor, maybe with some basic setting variations (destructible, Investigateable, etc.)
Locks access to the object as a Chest unless the player holds the matching Stash Hint.
You don't know the object holds an item until you find the Stash Hint item somewhere. This could be in an Agent's inventory, or hidden elsewhere in the chunk. 
###				C	Item: Stash Hint
Generates on NPC inventory or in a container in their chunk
Acts like a key, but when activated the agent will read text out loud that's specific to a Container type
This will be EXTREMELY annoying with Gravestones, which is kinda funny
##			C	Sugar System
Merchant Type: Sugar Shack √
Passive: Keep Moving (Acts like Stinger, but doesn't betray you. Red herring)

No interactions under any circumstances, even with Translator
###			C	Polyglot
Gain 2 languages on trait gain, and an additional one every two levels.
If put on an NPC, those are randomly chosen.
####			C	Polyglot as Speaker +
Set as Upgrade for all Speaker traits
Also gives 2 languages on upgrade, not just 1. This is for consistency and so that it's actually worth upgrading.
####			C	Polyglot as Polyglot +
This is an interesting pattern that might be mirrored in other meta-traits. 
If they generally represent knowledge, then turn all knowledge skills into meta-traits. 
E.g. Medical Professional is split up into competencies with various healing items that have unique bonuses rather than just a flat HP gain.
####			C	Chance for Relationship Gain
Chance to make someone Friendly if they speak that language and not English
###			C	Telepathic (rename)
Can talk to all languages, even Mutes, unless they have some anti-telepathy trait or something
This could belong in a different category, since it has broad applications.

###			C	Item Groups
uwumacaronitime's idea: Item groups similar to NPC groups

I can see this going two ways: 
- As a trait for NPCs to generate with
- As a designated item in the chunk creator for use in NPC & Object inventories. 

I am leaning towards implementing both of these. But whichever is chosen, make it very clear to avoid confusion.

Vanilla list:
- Defense
- Drugs
- Food
- Guns
- GunAccessory
- Melee

##		C	Relationships - Faction
###			C	00 Refactor
Put custom methods in faction traits.
E.g. Crushable.IsAlignedTo(Agent agent)
agent == vagent.crepe || agent.hastrait<crushable>
This logic can get very ugly so it'd be nice to pack it away elsewhere and just iterate through all applicable traits.
###			C	Faction Firefighter
###			C	Faction Cannibal
###			C	Faction Military
###			C	General concept
Friendly to faction doesn't align you. You do not inherit the faction's relationships.
Loyal causes you to inherit its relationships, but negative ones are moderated:
	Hostile → Annoyed
	Annoyed → Neutral
		The net effect of this one is that Loyalists are less likely to initate conflict on behalf of their faction.
Aligned means you fully inherit any faction-mandated relationships.

#		C	Mutators
Setting: Force Big Quest completion - If set to yes, you will need to complete your big quest before leaving the floor, if there is one. You will not be able to exit the floor until the BQ is done, even after completing all the missions on the floor. If the quest is failed (floor only fails dont count) you will spontaneously combust and die.

Setting: Exit on Death - If set to yes, you will be forced to exit the floor when you die. On the next floor, you will be revived and you will be healed to maximum HP.

Mutator: Exit Timer - Similar to Time Limit, except that the elevator is locked until the timer reaches zero. Missions will not open the elevator.

Mutator: Exit Timer EXTREME - Similar to Time Limit EXTREME, except that the timer is LONGER, and the elevator is locked until the timer reaches zero. Missions will not open the elevator.
